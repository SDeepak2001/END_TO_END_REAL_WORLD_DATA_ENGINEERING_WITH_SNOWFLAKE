END_TO_END_DATA_ENGINEERING_WITH_SNOWFLAKE

Led an end-to-end data pipeline project, transforming raw data from Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) into Snowflake using a Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture for ingesting, processing, and optimizing various datasets of an E-Commerce platform.

Implemented Snowflake Streams for change data capture, file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet), and created analytics-ready views, enhancing reporting capabilities and business intelligence insights.
